         <ul>
            <p class="w3-justify">&#127807;A valuable experience that I still keep in the box of my mind until now was when our family took care of a neighbors' cat that was in front of our house around last year. 
              We named the female cat as "Tim". Tim contracted Parvo disease at the time. The disease is only contagious to cats. Tim is infected from his sister named "Tina". 
              We do not have time to treat Tina because we found Tina's body in front of our fence. Our neighbor as the master of the two cats buried Tina's body. 
              Two days after Tina's death, Tim's condition became critical so we took her to the animal clinic for a check - up. Doctor tell that hope for recovery and life is very slim. 
              50/50. Our tears flowed down each other's cheeks. Sad to see Tim's dying condition. We were late to take her to the clinic because she was the first cat we treated. 
              We have never cared for and defended a cat before. This was the first time and we never found out about the disease. Only after the doctor told us about the existence of the disease did we know. 
              The doctor gave us Parvo medicine and I also bought Parvo medicine at the pharmacy as a spare. According to the doctor, the disease has been in Tim's body for a month. And doctor say the majority of cats will die from the disease. 
              Only a miraculous condition can prove that a cat can recover and live after contracting the disease. We monitor and take care of and give Tim Parvo medicine every day. The medicine was fed by us twice a day. 
              After a month Tim battled the disease, she finally recovered as usual. The doctor said the situation was amazing because we managed to treat Tim. Our front door neighbor once went to an animal clinic before we just had time to make an appointment it was so slow. 
              So, we helped her because Tim came to our house every day to eat and play with us. After the incident, Tim no longer belonged to his master and we never saw her again a week after the incident. According to his master, he once saw Tim go to a house and he called her but Tim no longer recognized him. 
              We are very sad because Tim has never come to our house until now. And we were only able to see Tim healthy for a week. After that, we never saw Tim again. We assume there are already new people who was became her new master. And that person is in this park as well who is our neighbor as well. 
              But her old master and we never knew who the person who took Tim from us was.</p>
