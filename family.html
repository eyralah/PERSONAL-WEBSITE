            <p class="w3-justify">This next chapter is my beloved part of my family. 
                My mother, Kasmawati Yahya who is 48 years old this year is a native of Pahang who was born on 19 December 1974. 
                She is the fifth child of six siblings. She is currently working as a nurse at a government organization clinic, the Bukit Goh Health Clinic.
                 Interestingly, she has been working as a nurse for almost 25 years. Before this, she used to work at the government hospital, Mentakab Hospital where I was born. 
                 Then, we turn to my sister. Nurul Nabilla Natasya binti Mohd Yusoff name was given. 22 years old of girl. We are only a year apart. Date of birth 4 February 2000 was also born in Pahang and the same hospital as me. 
                 We only have 2 siblings. She is currently studying at Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Pekan, Pahang for a bachelor's degree. Prior to this, she studied at the Kelantan Matriculation College in Selising, Kelantan as a diploma student for 2 years. 
                 The funny thing is my sister called me by the name "Yah" and I called her by the name "Lom"! My father was divorced from my mother when I was 2 years old and unfortunately my sister and I never saw his face.
                The map below is shown on the picture was took when we went holiday in Georgetown, Pulau Pinang and the pic was took by me.</p>
