         <ul>
            <p class="w3-justify">&#127793;Started to set foot in the school world from the age of 6 at the Tabika Kemas Felda Bukit Goh in Kuatan Pahang. 
         I went into the world of learning for only 1 year.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <p class="w3-justify">&#127793;The majority of second school per person are in national school. The same with me. 
                The name of Sekolah Kebangsaan (LKTP) Bukit Goh located at LKTP in Kuantan Pahang is no longer unfamiliar to the residents in the area. 
                "LKTP" stands for Laporan Keuangan Tahunan Perusahaan. During the 6 years of attending this school, it gave me many sweet memories when I remember it again. 
            And I got 3 A 1 B and 1 C for Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) when I am in class 6. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <p class="w3-justify">&#127793;After going through various experiences of love and sorrow in primary school, I moved forward by starting my studies in secondary school where I followed the flow in line with my increasing age. 
                Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Goh which was established near my housing estate, Felda Bukit Goh in Kuantan Pahang. This is where I gained knowledge for 5 years. 
                While in Form 3, I took an additional subject which is Arabic for Form 3 Assessment (PT3) and managed to get 6 A, 2 B and 1 E. Before the end of my schooling in secondary school, I obtained Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examination results of 5 A 1 C and 1 C+. 
                I am a student of the Geography subject stream. Geography is an elective subject that I take.</p>
        </ul>
        <img src="front.jpg" />
        <ul>
            <p class="w3-justify">&#127793;Now, I am already in Semester 5 which is my last semester as a student of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau Campus. I started setting foot here in 2019 where at that time I was just 18 years old. 
                But, now I am already 21 years old. So fast time passed that I did not realize that I had already been a student for 2 years 6 months. The Diploma in Information Management taught me a lot about the true meaning of knowledge. 
                Being in class 5 F has opened my eyes to the realities of real life because of too many candy - coated and bitter moments. There are also many challenges that I have faced especially related to group work. Oh before I forget! I once participated in a foot marching competition in Semester 1. 
                Platoon L stands for Platoon Lion gave us a lot of training so that we could be crowned as the third place at that time.</p>
