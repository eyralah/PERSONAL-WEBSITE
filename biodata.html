         <img src="WhatsApp Image 2022-01-18 at 17.32.51.jpeg" width="250" height="300">
<p class="w3-justify">Hooola my dear readers! Once you are on this sheet as I promised, I will reveal my true identity. 
  The name was given is Nurul Athirah Mohd Yusoff but as I mentioned before that you can all call me by the name Eyra. 
  This name is very special to me because of the late grandmother of my dearest who bestowed this call on me since I was 2 years old. 
  The birth at Hospital Mentakab in Pahang has already shown that I am a native of Pahang. I have lived in Bukit Goh, Kuantan Pahang since I was born into this world until now. 
  May 25, 2001 is my birthday so anyone who wants to give me a gift is welcome. As you can see, the picture and video on this page are mine. 
  Oh yes! My mom once told me that I was born at 11.00 P.M. where at that time she was sleeping suddenly I told my mother to wake up because I cannot wait to see the world.</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">In fact, many people do not know one of my secret that I am an introvert. Here, the "introvert" that is in me means that I am a shy person and will not reprimand people who I do not know him. 
    But, if the person reprimands me first, I can communicate calmly. That was not a problem for me. Being an "introvert" when I felt uncomfortable with the circumstances of the time. 
    Still, I can also be an "extrovert" when I am comfortable with the person who I get to know him or her. Getting to know someone makes me more open to reprimanding them first. 
    So, I can be an introvert and an extrovert in one time, just different circumstances of that time. I also became quiet when I had been surrounded by many people. 
    Maybe that is why I ever had many friends since I was little until now. It does not matter, the quality is more valuable than the quantity. 
    In fact, in general I am not a quiet person, only when I feel overwhelmed by the situation, I will be silent. 
    If there are readers here who come across me, please do not say I am arrogant because I will not smile at strangers at first! But, I will return the smile to the person who gave me the smile first. 
    I am not arrogant, it is just I am not the type of person to do something first. I am just being myself.</p>
